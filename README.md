## JavaScript 
### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is the foundational programming language when it comes to web development allowing developers to build complex web applications. 
* It is a scripting language meaning it does not need to be compiled, rather it can interpreted at runtime. 
* Most modern JavaScript interpreters utilize a technique called just-in-time compiling that improves performance.
* It is high-level meaning it is heavily abstracted typically making it easier to learn and use. 
* It can act as both a server-side and client-side language.
    * On the client-side JavaScript is commonly used to dynamically modify HTML and CSS via the DOM API.
    * On the server-side JavaScript may be used to pull data from a database. 

## TypeScript
### What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a variant of JavaScript released by Microsoft in 2012.

It adds types to the JavaScript programming language to help build more scalable and maintainable applications.

Before utilizing TypeScript programmers should have a strong understanding of the following JavaScript elements:
* Variables 
* Arrays
* Functions (Arrow functions)
* Objects
* Destructuring 

### Compiling TypeScript
TypeScript must be compiled into JavaScript so it can be read by a browser. 
TypeScript files have the .ts extension.
To compile TypeScript into JavaScript open up a terminal, make sure to change into the file directory, and then run:
```
tsc filename.ts
```
This will compile the TypeScript and then create a JavaScript file with the same name and a .js extension. 
To run that new file enter the following into the terminal:
```
node filename.js
```
