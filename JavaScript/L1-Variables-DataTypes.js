/*
VARIABLES & DATA TYPES
----------------------------------------
SUMMARY
* Primitive values and data types have no properties or methods.
*/

/*
// ----------------------------------------
// VARIABLES
* Variables can be declared using let, var, or const. 
* The var and let keywords work basically the same way the only difference being that var allows for hoisting.
* Hoisting is the process of using a variable before its been created.
* The var keyword will often be seen in legacy code. 
* Variables declared with const maintain the same value. 
* A variable that is declared but not assigned a value will return undefined.

let name = 'Asia';
var age = 28;
